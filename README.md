## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

How to centre the page without using any special effect like a position or display

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.page{
    margin: 70px auto;
    background-color: hsl(225, 100%, 98%);
    width: 250px;
    height: 445px;
    border-radius: 13px;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to learn more on flexbox

### Useful resources

- [Cloud convert](https://cloudconvert.com/) - This helped me to convert the images from svg format to a jpg format.
